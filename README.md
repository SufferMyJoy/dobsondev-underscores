# DobsonDev Underscores

This starting WordPress theme is based on [Underscores](http://underscores.me/) with [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/) hooked in for styling. Included with the theme are two shell scripts, one for OS X and one for Apache that will create the template theme for you.

## How to Use

Ideally you will want to add either the OS X or Apache (depending on your system) shell script to your PATH. This will enable you to call the script from anywhere. While you can do this however you want I like to just use an alias so I can edit the '_s-original' theme if I need to. Once you have the script setup and added into your PATH simply call it and answer the questions the script provides. Once you're done it will generate the theme for you.

The script was made to sit on a server and for you to call it from your 'themes' folder within your WordPress installation. The script will automatically change the ownership and permissions to the correct ones (your FTP account in that folder) automatically. This allows you to simply go into the WordPress install and then generate the theme right there.
